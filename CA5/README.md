# CA5: Dockerizing Gradle Applications

## Projects Overview

This assignment involves two Gradle-based projects:

- **gradle_basic_demo**: A simple chat server application built with Gradle, demonstrating basic Java application containerization.
- **gradle_transformation**: A Spring Boot web application that was originally a Maven project, transformed to use Gradle build system. It provides web services on port 8080.

Both projects implement two Docker containerization strategies to compare build approaches.

## Docker Strategies

### ChatApp Version 1:
- **Approach**: Clone the repository and compile the application directly within the Docker container.

```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:17

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git

RUN git clone https://github.com/mario-baptista/cogsi2526-1211265-1250525-1250204.git /app

WORKDIR /app/CA2/Part1/gradle_basic_demo

RUN chmod +x ./gradlew

RUN ./gradlew jar

EXPOSE 59001

CMD ["java", "-cp", "build/libs/basic_demo-0.1.0.jar", "basic_demo.ChatServerApp", "59001"]
```
### Line-by-Line Breakdown:
- FROM eclipse-temurin:17: Starts with a full JDK 17 image needed for compilation
- RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git: Installs Git to clone repository
- RUN git clone...: Downloads entire source history and code into /app
- WORKDIR...: Sets working directory to the project folder
- RUN chmod +x ./gradlew: Makes Gradle wrapper executable
- RUN ./gradlew jar: Downloads Gradle, all dependencies, compiles code, and creates JAR
- EXPOSE 59001: Documentation-only port declaration (It informs users and other containers which ports the application inside the container is intended to use, it doesnt export the port).
- CMD...: Runs the chat server

### ChatApp Version 2:
- **Approach**: Build the application on the host machine and copy the resulting JAR file into the Docker image.

```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:17

COPY basic_demo-0.1.0.jar /app/app.jar

WORKDIR /app

EXPOSE 59001

CMD ["java", "-cp", "app.jar", "basic_demo.ChatServerApp", "59001"]
```
### Line-by-Line Breakdown:
- FROM eclipse-temurin:17: Uses JDK image
- COPY...: File copy from host build context into container
- WORKDIR /app: Sets working directory
- EXPOSE 59001: Port declaration
- CMD...: Runs the pre-built JAR

### Spring Application Version 1: 

- **Approach**: Clone the repository and compile the application directly within the Docker container.
```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:17

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git

RUN git clone https://github.com/mario-baptista/cogsi2526-1211265-1250525-1250204.git /app

WORKDIR /app/CA2/Part2/GradleProject_Transformation

RUN chmod +x ./gradlew

RUN ./gradlew bootJar

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["java", "-jar", "build/libs/GradleProject_Transformation.jar"]
```

### Line by line breakdown:

- FROM eclipse-temurin:17: Starts with a full JDK 17 image needed for compilation
- RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git: Installs Git to clone repository
- RUN git clone...: Downloads entire source history and code into /app
- WORKDIR...: Sets working directory to the project folder
- RUN chmod +x ./gradlew: Makes Gradle wrapper executable
- RUN ./gradlew jar: Downloads Gradle, all dependencies, compiles code, and creates JAR
- EXPOSE 8080: Documentation-only port declaration.
- CMD...: Runs the spring application


### Spring Application Version 2:
- **Approach**: Build the application on the host machine and copy the resulting JAR file into the Docker image.
- 
```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:17

COPY GradleProject_Transformation.jar /app/app.jar

WORKDIR /app

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```
### Line-by-Line Breakdown:
- FROM eclipse-temurin:17: Uses JDK image
- COPY...: File copy from host build context into container
- WORKDIR /app: Sets working directory
- EXPOSE 8080: Port declaration
- CMD...: Runs the pre-built JAR



### Build

```bash
docker build -t gradle_basic_demo_v1 .
docker build -t gradle_transformation_v1 .
docker build -t gradle_transformation_v2 .
docker build -t gradle_basic_demo_v2 .
```

### Run

```bash
docker run -d -p 59001:59001 --name basic_demo_v1 gradle_basic_demo_v1
docker run -d -p 59002:59001 --name basic_demo_v2 gradle_basic_demo_v2
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name transformation_v1 gradle_transformation_v1
docker run -d -p 8081:8080 --name transformation_v2 gradle_transformation_v2
```

### Port Mapping:
- Chat apps: 59001→59001 (v1) and 59002→59001 (v2)
- Spring apps: 8080→8080 (v1) and 8081→8080 (v2)

## Docker History Analysis

Using `docker history <image>` to inspect layer composition:

### Image Size Comparison
- **Version 1**: Typically larger due to inclusion of:
  - Git
  - Gradle wrapper and dependencies
  - Source code and intermediate build artifacts
  - Full JDK for compilation
- **Version 2**: Smaller and more efficient:
  - Only contains the runtime JRE
  - Single JAR file
  - Minimal base image layers

### Layer Composition Differences
- **Version 1** shows multiple layers for cloning, dependency resolution, and compilation steps.
- **Version 2** has fewer layers, primarily focused on copying the JAR and setting up the runtime.

### Performance Implications
- Version 1: Slower builds but consistent environments.
- Version 2: Faster image creation and smaller distribution size.

Both approaches were implemented for both demo projects to compare the methodologies in practice.

**Key Differences**: Version 1 Dockerfiles include the full source and build process, resulting in larger images with build dependencies. Version 2 Dockerfiles are simpler, copying only the final JAR, leading to smaller, faster images.

| Version | Characteristics                                                 | Size Implication          |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1       | Full source, Gradle wrapper, Git, dependencies, build artifacts | Larger images             |
| 2       | Only runtime + JAR                                              | Smaller, efficient images |
